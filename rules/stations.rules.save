    // Acquire the door that triggered the rule by:
    // - use filter remove the Contacts that are not saved to persitence yet (i.e. lastUpdate returns null)
    // - use sortBy to order the members by lastUpdate, the most recent will be last
    // - get the last updated Item, Contacts are unlikely to change within 100 msec of each other so this approach works
    //   If they are likely to change that close together this approach will fail
